## Typescript

I have 3+ years experience with TS. It has really been a game changer to me. Code faster, code better.

## Parcel

[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is my to-go bundler, from rapid-prototyping to small-to-medium projects. I like the zero-config approach, and I only need to tweak my Babel or Webpack config if I need to.

## React

React has been my front-end companion for 5+ years. I like the big community behind it and the volume of third-party apps it has. I especially appreciate the introduction of hooks synchronization over lifecycle components.

## Redux

Redux has also been a faithful companion over the years. It is my favorite state management solution in React projects.

Check here this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@franleweb/redux-with-typescript-f97dc862f2b) I wrote about using Typescript with Redux

## Redux Saga

Sagas is my favorite tool for side-effects and asynchronous management of the Redux store. I like the generator approach and the possibility to do advanced stuff such as cancelling a task or just pick the latest occurrence.

## CSS

I have an extended knowledge of CSS but I use rarely since I prefer to rely on a framework (here, Material UI). When I do, I usually go with plain CSS instead of pre-processors like LESS or SASS because I believe you can do a lot with modern CSS. If the project grew bigger, I'd then favor pre-processors.

I also like the JS-CSS approach or the typed CSS one.

## Material UI

MUI is always a serious candidate when it is time to pick up a design framework, but there are a ton of other candidates which also do the job.

## Mapbox

I like Mapbox over other solutions like Google Maps or OpenMap because it is highly customizable.

## Firebase database

I use Firestore for storing data

## Firebase hosting

I've chosen Firebase for the hosting in this app. I generally like what solutions like Firebase or Heroku offer.

## Storybook

Feel free to run the story via `npm run storybook` or `yarn storybook`. I like Storybook because it helps focus on the design and behaviors of the components while being able to easily share it with the different teams.

## Prettier

I like prettier because it takes out of the equation the burden of formatting your code - which you don't realize the time you waste with it until you use tools like prettier.
